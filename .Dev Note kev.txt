// Note Kevin:
add more const char for reading in existing map (the entities)
    generate player_walkable_cell

move read_file to main (include all classes)
    int player_generated - counter for if all players are generated -> random won't spawn any player
    bool entity_generated -> anytime map contains an entity (== true) - ramdom generation wont happen

spawn player - check cell_type
    generate cell_type (floor_tile)
    generate entity / player (call constructor)
    update floor's field (add to vectors)

c1->get_cell_at(in index) = c1.chambervector[2] 

EntitySpawnable* get_cell_at(int index) {
    return interior_tiles[index]
}

setter/getter for cells - return / change, entity / player on

NEED getters-setters:
    cell has:
        player_walkable: Boolean
        entity_spawnable: Boolean
    EntitySpawnable has:
        player_walkable: True
        entity_spawnable: True

getter setter for PC* for PWC

detach Entity from Entityspawnable when changing boolean when entity consumed/died
