does the consume_item method for items call the destructor, or does the vector that stores it calls 
the destructor?

consume_item will return a player*, implement in main: player* = consume_item(player*) (thats how decorators work)

check player_is_killed after player consumes a potion, can get -HP potion and killed

since merchant only attacks the player once aggro, need to check in main loop outside of the 
merchant attack method:
if (player.get_merch_stat() == false)
